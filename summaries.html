            <h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Rationing in Canada during World War II (Daniel)</h2>
            <p>Rationing in Canada during WW2 was a method introduced to ensure a fair distribution of goods to people. This was to support the soldiers overseas during the war. Even though the country was a reliable producer, a lot of its output was directed to the soldiers, creating a shortage of food and resources at home. This influenced Canadians to change their diets, and travel with cars less since gasoline was also distributed with rationings. For instance, they used margarine instead of butter, and honey as a substitute for sugar.</p>

            <h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">The Wartime Industry in Canada during World War II (Joshua)</h2>
            <p>Canada's wartime industry began in 1939, shortly after Canada entered World War II, and expanded quickly after the establishment of the Department of Munitions in 1940. The federal government created the department to supply munitions to Canada and its allies, and to address coordination issues, shortages, and slow production of war resources that had existed since the beginning of the war. The Department of Munitions oversaw the production of munitions, including rifles and other artillery to combat enemy vehicles, as well as a multipurpose 25-pounder artillery piece. The department was also instrumental in vehicle production, overseeing the mass production of 815,729 military vehicles, of which 45,710 were armoured. The Department of Munitions sparked tremendous growth in 1940, leading Canada to rank 4th among the Allies in wartime industrial production. It transformed Canada'swartime industry into a highly organised, large-scale production system ever since.</li>

            <h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px;">War Bonds in Canada during World War II (Rayan)</h2>
            <p>The first Canadian war loan was issued in November 1915. The term Victory loan was first used during the fourth campaign in November 1917. That loan offered $150 million in 5.5% bonds (some as small as $50). It was very successful and brought in $398 million, which was about $50 for every person in the country. Two more Victory Loans in 1918 and 1919 raised another $1.34 billion. During the Second World War, after a slow second war loan in 1940, the government brought back Victory Loans with colorful posters and strong patriotic advertising. Nine Victory Loans were held from June 15, 1941 to November 1945, raising almost $12 billion in total. About 52% came from businesses, and the rest from individual Canadians.</p>

            <p style="padding: 15px 0px;">Women started working during the war. They had jobs such as nurses and munition manufacturers. Women got jobs to fill in for the men that went to war. The first women services in the army were made to help support the air force and the army.</p>
