            <h2>Rationing</h2>
            <p>Canada’s wartime industry began in 1939, shortly after Canada entered World War II, and expanded quickly after the establishment of the Department of Munitions in 1940. The federal government created the department to supply munitions to Canada and its allies, and to address coordination issues, shortages, and slow production of war resources that had existed since the beginning of the war. The Department of Munitions oversaw the production of munitions, including rifles and other artillery to combat enemy vehicles, as well as a multipurpose 25-pounder artillery piece. The department was also instrumental in vehicle production, overseeing the mass production of 815,729 military vehicles, of which 45,710 were armoured. The Department of Munitions sparked tremendous growth in 1940, leading Canada to rank 4th among the Allies in wartime industrial production. It transformed Canada’s wartime industry into a highly organised, large-scale production system ever since.</p>
